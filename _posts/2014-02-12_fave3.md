blurb: "Medium, a read / write web site that hosts, 'everyone's stories and ideas' is very nice. I pretty much love everything about it's simplicity of design and intuitive interface. I particularly love the way notes are nested on the side of the reading interface. You just see little comment marks and with a few clicks can see how many notes were left. Along with the quick access to leaving your own notes. Simple and elegant. Love it!"

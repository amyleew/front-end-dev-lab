blurb: "Moves, is a simple app for the iOS that tracks your location continuously, uses very little power and is designed to run in the background. This app is designed not to visualise data but encourage developers to use Moves API to download the data and map it as they please. Very open source. And then, Nicholas Felton created a Processing application, MMapper, for the Moves.app API to collect and map the places, distances and gps coordinates data."

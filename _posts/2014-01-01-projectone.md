# Enoch Pratt Library Pitch

The Enoch Pratt RE: Stack is an initiative to bring the index and access of the Public Library to a computer, device or mobile interface near you.

Think Dewey Decimal Classification system, intelligent web bots, every helpful and knowledgeable librarian youâ€™ve ever met and avid to casual readers young and old. The focus is to create an interface that promotes connection between readers, the wealth of library knowledge and the joy and curiosity of reading.
